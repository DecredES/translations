so let's talk about what it is to be
00:07
fork resistant what's the point of
00:09
having a maximum supply of 21 million if
00:12
you can't protect yourself against
00:14
contentious hard fork that will inflate
00:16
the supply by creating a new project out
00:18
thin air
00:19
at the time of a chain split or
00:21
contentious hard fork an offshoot
00:23
project is created it's at this point
00:25
that the miners have to decide which
00:27
chain to designate their hash power too
00:30
in the case of bitcoin the longest chain
00:32
or the chain with the most amount of
00:34
hash power becomes the dominant chain
00:36
in a non-contentious hard fork this is
00:38
the end of the matter and the old chain
00:41
will cease to exist unfortunately it's
00:43
rarely as simple as this and the
00:45
non-dominant chain can remain
00:47
indefinitely this can be seen in the
00:49
case of bitcoin cash bitcoin sv and
00:52
ethereum classic
00:54
now whichever side of this debate you're
00:56
on i think most people would agree that
00:58
in the end there should only be one
00:59
